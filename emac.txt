*recursion: when you get to your target, the main initial condition will be satisfied then you just
return results. it's basically a for loop but instead going linearly you just do small steps each time

val it = [] : 'a list

* SOME expression creates data type of type OPTION expression e..g SOME "HI" create data type of type OPTION String
* NONE creates data type of type OPTION
* issome checks if we have string option, int option, real option and etc..... returns true or fasle
* valof is similar
*valOf(SOME "my string"); would return the string "my string"
** [1,2]@[4,3]  ===========> [1,2,4,3]
** 2::[1,3] ---------------------> [2,1,3]
* use option instead of raising exception if you want to avoid undefined values such as deviding by zero.
*option is a data type instead of exception.. use it to return NONE or Some of 'a e.g. Some of "hello" i.e Some expression
use valof(SOME "hello") to convert from OPTION string to string. use when function may not return anything.
Another example: if expression then NONE else SOME expression
* a = 10;
   a= 5 ; this is shadowing not assingment the first a = 10 is not changed but shadowed just like how pointers
work. the REPL will type in Hidden Value than showing the old shadowed values.
** when you type use "file name" it shows you the bindings, type of arguments and return type if any.
e.g. val pow = fn : int * int --> int i.e you put arguments separated by commas then -> return type
or val x = 4: int or val fun = 544: int
for a list e.g. val x = [2,3,55] the binding will look like val x = [2,3,55]: int list or val x = [(3,2),(2,4)] the binding
will look like val x = [[3,2),(2,5)] (int * int) list
another example is val x = [] will give binding like val x =[]: 'a list
another example is null; will give binding like val it = fn: 'a list ->bool
*you can access elements of lists or tuples using hash # e.g. #month date
*you don't need to use keyword return to return in ML. Just put your expression right there.
* (expression, expression) is a pair. Tuples are 3 expressions.  pairs and tuples elements can be of any type
whereas Lists elements have to be of the same type
* ~ is negative instead of -
* :: is called cons and it constructs or adds items to the front/begining of a list e.g. val x [2,3,4]
44::x gives [44,2,3,4]
* [] is empty
* null expression --> null here is a function that returns true of expression is an empty list otherwise false
* hd is a function that returns first item, tl returns all the items in the list except the first one
* div and mod are math functions
* trying to take hd or tl of an empty list will throw exception
** fun blah(date: DATE list): DATE list = ---> notice return type . you have to write type of list not just list
**all arguments in a conditioon have to be the same the ones with if and the ones with else
(* sum = 7 is not assignment *) more like == in java return boolean

** no mutation in SML. meaning when you create a value like a string it doesn't change at all. it's a like a securtiy feature so e.g. whe you create a list

PATTERN MATCHING: | is like else, 
val x = 3;
val x = 3 : int
- case x of
=     1 => "one" => is return type
=   | 2 => "two"
=   | 3 => "three";
stdIn:40.1-43.15 Warning: match nonexhaustive
          1 => ...
          2 => ...
          3 => ...

val it = "three" : string
-----------------------------------
Here are the rules of pattern matching; they must be applied recursively:
* fun blah(str: int ) = you don't have to put : return type = !!!!!!!!!!!!! why!
The _ pattern matches everything;
The c pattern matches only itself;
Pattern x matches every value, with the additional result that identifier x is bound to the value it matched;
Pattern (p1,..., pn) matches value (v1,...,vn) iff all patterns pi match their corresponding values vi;
Pattern {x1= p1,...,xn= pn} matches value {x1=v1, ..., xn=vn} iff patterns pi match their corresponding values vi;
Pattern [] matches [];
Pattern p1::p2 matches list l iff pattern p1 matches hd l and pattern p2 matches tl l. means if you can find a header then name it p1 and a tail then name it p2
Pattern X matches X;
Pattern X(p) will match only value X(v), assuming that pattern p matches value v;
Note that pattern _::[] could have also been written as [_].
tail recursive
** {first="kal", middle="bob", last="johnson"} :: [] = [ {first="kal", middle="bob", last="johnson"} ]
recursion vs tail recursion
**
You need to have the same return type for all patterns.
fun card_value (suit, rank) =
  case rank of
      Ace => 14
    | King => 13
    | Queen => 12

** use ^ to concatenate strings
** List is a built-in function and

it sounds as if though
------------
The fun syntax is syntactic sugar for fn, so anything that you can write with the former can also be written with the latter.

fn directly represents ?-abstraction, which means it is limited to functions of one argument (see this SO 
question). fun is convenient shorthand that allows you to curry a multi-argument function and bind a
 name to it with a single bit of syntax,
--------------
(fn x => fn y => x+y) 2 3; works. fn simply doesn't have the same syntactic sugar to define curried functions that fun has.


---------------
currying function is one that doesn't take all its arguments up front.. you give it only first argument which
returns another function which you're supposed to call it with the second argument which returns
a function which you're supposed to call with the third argument and so on and so forth. The result
is the last function to be called in this chain.
-------------
**String.sub(string, index) e.g. String.sub("hi there", 0) returns h (i.e return character at given index)
**Char.isUpper("") should return true or false
 **List.filter (fn s => Char.isUpper(String.sub(s, 0))) ["hi", "hello","Bah","Fuck","Zig Zag", "sd"];
---> returns a list of only words that starts with capital letter. 
** List.filter(curried function that takes list_name as initial value --> ?? ) list_name is a curried function that takes one argument a function 
and returns a list for values evaluated to be true. filter will go over each item in the list
Exampl:
val is_sorted = fn x => (fn y => x <= y)
val test0 = (is_sorted 1) 2

val is_sorted = fn : int -> int -> bool
val test0 = true : bool
** fn means curried funnction
** high order function are
** List.fold1 takes 2 arguments: curried function that receive 2 args & 2 arguments.
**All List functions will loop automatically through given list.
** String.size("hi") = 2
**
fun longest_string1(lst: string list): string= list.fold1 (fn (x,y) => if String.size(x) > String.size(y) then x else y) "" lst
	
"" aa
bb aa
cc aa
dd aa
aa
-------------------------
**val bindngs means theres equation.
** fun x( f: int * int -> bool) Notice the arrow here is different from arrow here:
fn(x,y) => if x then x else y Here arrow is for currying whereas the previosu one is for type of function
** Any normal function can receive a curried function e.g.
fun longest_string_helper(help: int * int => bool)
** fun foo (x,y) = x + y 1st args is a tuple of 2 ints
Has the type:
fn : int * int -> int
** fun bar x y = x + y here it takes one args which is x and return a function y
It has the type:
fn : int -> int -> int
** SML only has single argument functions; foo(x,y) is a function foo taking a single argument, the tuple (x, y).
**o composition operator (eg. val x = foo o bar, where foo and bar are both functions)
Ex.
val longest_capitalized = longest_string1 o only_capitals

** Composition: val x = y o z is like saying y(z)
** String.explode("hello bi"); returns a list of all character
val it = [#"h",#"e",#"l",#"l",#"o",#" ",#"b",#"i"] : char list
** List.rev([1,2,3]); rev takes a list of ints or characters and return reversed list
val it = [3,2,1] : int list
- List.rev(["h","e","l"]);
val it = ["l","e","h"] : string list
**  String.explode "hi";
val it = [#"h",#"i"] : char list
- String.implode [#"h",#"i",#" ",#"y",#"a"];
val it = "hi ya" : string  --------------> you don't have to call function with parenthesis!!!
**  String.implode([#"1",#"0",#"0",#"1",#"1",#"0"]); 
val it = "100110" : string
  String.implode([#"h",#"e",#"l"]);
val it = "hel" : string
****
 val rev_string = implode o rev o explode;
val rev_string = fn : string -> string
- rev_string "hello";
val it = "olleh" : string
**('a -> 'b option) -> 'a list -> 'b.
** NONE => first_answer f tail
 
means call function first_answer and send 2 arguments.
** exception NoAnswer

raise NoAnswer

**- let
   val a = 1
   val b = 2
in

end;
val it = 5 : int
- in end evaluated but inside let is not
*Every expression in SML has a type. 
**() is the only value of the type unit, the unit type, a type that carries no information. All functions in ML take exactly one
 parameter. The unit type can be used as the parameter type and/or
 return type of a function that performs side effects and don't need to take or return (respectively) any
 information. It should then be said that this val it = () : unit occurs in those situations when the interactive top-level is 
interested in some side-effect such as interpreting the content of a file and loading its effect into the top-level. – Simon Shine Oct
